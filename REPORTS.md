# Day 1 - 21/07/2021
    Today I implemented basically all fundamental gameplay mechanics, such as the player and the ball movements. 
    I was also able to get the ball reseted when a player scores, and it is also waiting 3 seconds to start moving when it is reseted!

# Day 3 - 26/07/2021

    Yes, I forgot to report Day 2 hauahuahua that was when I implemented the score controller and the timer, as well as balanced the player gameplay.
    Today I implemented the initial menu, that will appear when the user starts the game! All the buttons are already working, but the Options menu does
not have anything to be controlled. I also still need to implement a singleplayer version of the game, using an AI to play against the user. I think this is going
to be a problem :')
    I also want to implement some control options for the player at the option menu.

# Day 4 - 28/07/2021

    Today I implemented the pause menu that we can see during a match in the game! All the buttons are working well, but we have nothing at the settings menu.
    I changed the "Options" button on the Initial Menu to a "Controls" button, where I display the controls used in the game.
    I also added the scene for the Singleplayer part of the game, but I still think it will be a challenge to implement an AI for it, but that's what I'll try next day.
Actually, I think i will take my today's free time searching it in the internet, maybe I can find some help hauhahua.
