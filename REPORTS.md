# Day 1 - 21/07/2021
    Today I implemented basically all fundamental gameplay mechanics, such as the player and the ball movements. 
    I was also able to get the ball reseted when a player scores, and it is also waiting 3 seconds to start moving when it is reseted!

# Day 3 - 26/07/2021

    Yes, I forgot to report Day 2 hauahuahua that was when I implemented the score controller and the timer, as well as balanced the player gameplay.
    Today I implemented the initial menu, that will appear when the user starts the game! All the buttons are already working, but the Options menu does
not have anything to be controlled. I also still need to implement a singleplayer version of the game, using an AI to play against the user. I think this is going
to be a problem :')
    I also want to implement some control options for the player at the option menu.

# Day 4 - 28/07/2021

    Today I implemented the pause menu that we can see during a match in the game! All the buttons are working well, but we have nothing at the settings menu.
    I changed the "Options" button on the Initial Menu to a "Controls" button, where I display the controls used in the game.
    I also added the scene for the Singleplayer part of the game, but I still think it will be a challenge to implement an AI for it, but that's what I'll try next day.
Actually, I think i will take my today's free time searching it in the internet, maybe I can find some help hauhahua. 

# Day 5 - 30/07/2021

    Today I implemented the AI for the singleplayer, but still need some improvement. I also want to put difficulty levels by changing the velocity and lerp of the AI
(it is already implemented at the UI).
    I also implemented the settings menu, with graphics, fullscreen toggle and difficulty levels.

# Day 6 - 02/08/2021

  Today I implemented the difficulty system :) at first I didn't know how to implement it, thought that using events would work, but I could not make it happen, so I
implemented in the simplest way I could.
    I would like to start the audio system today (putting some music for the buttons and menus, and for the gameplay) but my head is full, i'm just gonna rest,
university is starting next week, as well the game jam i'm going to participate :)
